# Cloud-Based Event Management and Booking System for Middlesex University

This project is a full-stack web application developed to streamline event booking at Middlesex University.  
It enables students and staff to register, log in, browse events, and make bookings through a responsive, browser-based interface.

The system was built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

> **Note:** Full AWS deployment (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda) was originally planned but not completed due to time constraints.  
> However, the system is structured to support future cloud integration.
